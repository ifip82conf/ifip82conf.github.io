We invite those interested in participating to submit one of the following:
- Full research papers (7,000 words maximum)
- Shorter position papers or posters that engage with an aspect of the conference theme (3,000 words maximum). Accepted short papers will be clustered (thematically, or as juxtapositions) and presented in grouped sessions.  Each paper will be allocated a 10 min slot for presentation.  To facilitate discussion all papers will be made available before the conference.  We will also offer the option to add a link to a video presentation of the paper (webcam quality), which participants can review before arrival.  Both of these formats, together with the conference presentation, should create multiple opportunities for engagement.

We would also welcome suggestions for alternative and experimental formats for presenting work and for fostering dialogue at the conference.

All submissions are anonymous and will be double blind reviewed by the conference Programme Committee.

The main conference proceedings will be published by Springer as a volume of the IFIP ACIT (Advances in Information and Communication Technology) series.  The conference proceedings will be available for purchase at the conference.

Papers should follow these [author guidelines](http://springer) using the appropriate template from the Springer website.
