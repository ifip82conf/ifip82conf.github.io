## Getting there:

### From the airport:
AirCoach 702 and 703 bring you to Blackrock, leaving you with 15-20 min walk to the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School campus.

Dublin Bus 747 (Dublin Airport to Heuston Station) will bring you to city centre where you can transfer to bus (routes 4, 7, and 8) or Dart rail services.

Taxis are plentiful from the airport and around Dublin city centre.


### From the city:
There are a number of websites that will help you to plan your travels within Ireland and within Dublin. 

www.getthere.ie will help you to plan trips around Ireland. Public transport options in Ireland are Iarnród Éireann (Train) and Bus Éireann.

​www.hittheroad.ie will help you plan trips around Dublin city, providing you with options and estimated travel times. Public transport options in Dublin are Dublin Bus, Luas (Tram), and Dart (Train). Bus and Dart drop you in Blackrock village which is approximately 15-20 min walk from the campus.

If you plan to stay in Dublin for any length of time and plan to use public transport throughout, you might be interested in purchasing a Leap Card. This card is economical if you plan to use public transportation a great deal throughout your stay. If you plan to use the Dart and only to get to Blackrock for the two days of IFIP, then the card is not worth its cost.
